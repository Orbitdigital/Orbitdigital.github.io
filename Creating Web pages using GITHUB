Creating Web pages using GITHUB

1. Create file folder for your site on your local machine
2. Open command line and CD to your folder directory
3. Use 'git init' to create a GIT repository on your local machine for your chosen directory
4. Use 'git status' to check that files have been added to your GIT repository on your local machine.
5. Use 'git add .' to add your files to your LOCAL GIT repository.
6. Use 'git commit -m 'initial commit' to commit your files to the LOCAL GIT repository.
7. Create a new repository in GIT
8. Copy the code from the 'push an existing repository from the command line', for example, "git remote add origin https://github.com/Orbitdigital/site.github.io.git
git push -u origin master"

You can also change 'origin' to 'git' in the above code if you have already created an 'origin' directory

Making Changes to files in your directory and pushing live:

1. Update the files in your local directory on your local machine
2. Run 'git status' to check that files have been updated.
3. Run 'git add .'
4. Run 'git commit -m 'update details' to commit the changes to your local GIT repository
5. Run 'git push origin master' to push the changes from local GIT repository to GITHUB server repository.

Note: You can also use 'git' instead of 'origin' in  the above code if already created a master repository.
